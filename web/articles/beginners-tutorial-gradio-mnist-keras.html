            <h2>Beginner's Tutorial to Gradio: Creating a Sketchpad for a Keras MNIST Model</h2>

            <p>Gradio is a python library that makes it easy to turn your machine learning models into visual interfaces!
              This tutorial shows you how to do that with the "Hello World" of machine learning models: a model that we train
              from scratch to classify hand-written digits on the MNIST dataset. By the end, you will create an interface
              that allows you to draw handwritten digits and see the results of the classifier. This post comes with a companion
              collaboratory notebook that allows you to run the code (and embed the interface) directly in a browser window.

            <h3>Installing Gradio</h3>
            <p>If you haven't already installed gradio, go ahead and do so. It's super easy as long as you have Python3 already on your machine:</p>
            <h3>The MNIST Dataset</h3>
            <p>The MNIST dataset consists of images of handwritten digits. We'll be training a model to classify the image
            into the digit written, from 0 through 9. Here is a sample of handwritten digits.</p>
            <h3>Training a Keras Model</h3>
            <p>By using the keras API from the tensorflow package, we can train a model in just a few lines of code. Here,
            we're not going to train a very complicated model -- it'll just be a fully connected neural network. Since we're
            not really going for record accuracies, let's just train it only for 5 epochs.</p>
            <h3>Launching a Gradio Interface</h3>
            <p>Now that we have our keras model trained, we'll want to actually define the interface. What's the appropriate
            interface to use? For the input, we can use a sketchpad, so that users can use their cursor to create new </p>
