        <p>Gradio is a free, open-source python library that helps machine
          learning researchers <strong>interact</strong> with and <strong>share</strong> their machine
        learning models with collaborators and clients with only a few lines of extra code.</p>
        <p>With gradio, you can easily generate in-browser interfaces that
        enable you to enter various forms of input for your model and explore
          the behavior of your model immediately. Gradio also generates <strong>links</strong>
        that can be shared with collaborators and other audiences, so they can
        interact with the model without setting up any software or even having
        any background in machine learning or software at all!</p>

        <p>Gradio was developed by researchers at Stanford University and is

        <h2>Fast, easy setup</h2>
        <p>Using Gradio only requires adding a couple lines of code to your
        project. You can install Gradio from pip and deploy your model in
        seconds. Once launched, you can choose from a variety of interface
        types to interact with, iterate over, and improve your models.</p>

        <h2>Present and share</h2>
        <p>Gradio present an interface that is intuitive to engineers and
        non-engineers alike, and thus a valuable tool in sharing insights from
        your models. When Gradio launches a model, it also creates a link you
        can share with colleagues that lets them interact with the model
        on your computer remotely from their own devices.</p>

        <h2>Embed and go</h2>
        <p>Gradio can be embedded in Jupyter and Colab notebooks, in blogs and
        websites, and screenshotted for use in research papers. These features
        all help your models be more easily shared and consumed with a larger
        audience.</p>
